          <blockquote>Ever since my family purchased their first personal computer back in 2002, I always had a strong
            interest in computers.  As a child, I would ask my parents about how a computer actually works,
            but they would always give me an answer that only a five-year old would understand.  As I grew up,
             I kept my passion for computers.  During my freshman year of high school, I worked part time at a country club
             caddying and eventually, I saved up enough money to buy all the components needed to build the entire tower myself.
               Additionally, I have also troubleshooted and successfully recovered “dead” computers by replacing necessary
               hardware in many of my friend’s computers during my high school years.  When it was time to decide which major
               to choose in college, it was a no-brainer, Computer Science.  During my second semester of college, my friends
               were talking about going to a hackathon, HackBU, where we would spend 24 hours coding.  During the event I
               attended various programming workshops and Tech Talks, which was a great way for me to develop additional
               skills in my field and be exposed to this kind of programming environment.

        <blockquote>One of my favorite projects was done at Cooper Union during a 24-hour hackathon.
          Our project was to extract tweets from the Twitter API using Java and exporting those tweets and other data
          to a JSON file.  Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, we created a tribunal system that acts as a community policing
          program.  My job in this team was to use Java and the Twitter API to query their database for the most recent
          tweet containing the string we were searching for.  Additionally, I worked on the front-end of our program, using
          Javascript, it received data from our JSON file and displayed that information on our page along with its interface.  During Hack
          Cooper, we were presented with a task to do something related to Hack Harassment.  My team and I realized that we
          could improve the social networking experience by giving incentives to report offensive users.  In order to
          increase reports on disrespectful users, we decided to game-ify our project by giving participants badges to add
          to their profile.  Due to the rise of cyberbullying on social networks, finding a way to help the community
          "remove" offensive posts was a great way to contribute to the Hack Harassment movement.
